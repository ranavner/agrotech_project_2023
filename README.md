# Agrotech Project - 2023

In our agrotech project we have decided to make a smart watering system.
We seperated our 'grass field' into 4 areas, each one is controlled by it's own humidity sensor and a valve.
Furthermore, we added a camera that takes a photo of the whole field and sends it to the cloud.
Also, a motion sensor is located above the crops so it can notify the user of any movements that occures in the area.

All the data is sent real-time into a streamlit app that can be accessed from all over the world.
## The app includes: 
1. Humidity values
2. Valve status
3. Temperture
4. VPD 
5. Motion alert
6. Last photo taken (5 minutes intervals)
7. Analyzed photo (showing yellow areas that require special attention)
