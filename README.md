# Agrotech Project - 2023

In our agrotech project we have decided to make a smart watering system.
We seperated our 'grass field' into 4 areas, each one is controlled by it's own humidity sensor and a valve.
Furthermore, we added a camera that takes a photo of the whole field and sends it to the cloud.
Also, a motion sensor is located above the crops so it can notify the user of any movements that occures in the area.
